# Pybind11 bindings for the Abseil C++ Common Libraries

[TOC]

## Overview

These adapters make Abseil types work with Pybind11 bindings. For more
information on using Pybind11, see
g3doc/third_party/pybind11/google3_utils/README.md.

To use the converters listed below, just include the header
in the .cc file with your bindings:

```
#include "pybind11_abseil/absl_casters.h"
```

Support for non-const `absl::Span` for numeric types is also available by
including a separated header file:

```
#include "pybind11_abseil/absl_numpy_span_caster.h"
```

## absl::Duration

`absl::Duration` objects are converted to/ from python datetime.timedelta objects.
Therefore, C code cannot mutate any datetime.timedelta objects from python.

## absl::Time

`absl::Time` objects are converted to/from python datetime.datetime objects.
Additionally, datetime.date objects can be converted to `absl::Time` objects.
C code cannot mutate any datetime.datetime objects from python.

Python date objects effectively truncate the time to 0 (ie, midnight).
Python time objects are not supported because `absl::Time` would implicitly
assume a year, which could be confusing.

### Time zones
Python `datetime` objects include timezone information, while
`absl::Time` does not. When converting from Python to C++, if a timezone is
specified then it will be used to determine the `absl::Time` instant. If no
timezone is specified by the Python `datetime` object, the local timezone is
assumed.

When converting back from C++ to Python, the resultant time will be presented in
the local timezone and the `tzinfo` property set on the `datetime` object to
reflect that. This means that the caller may receive a datetime formatted
in a different timezone to the one they passed in. To handle this safely, the
caller should take care to check the `tzinfo` of any returned `datetime`s.

## absl::CivilTime
`absl::CivilTime` objects are converted to/from Python datetime.datetime
objects. Fractional Python datetime components are truncated when converting to
less granular C++ types, and time zone information is ignored.

## absl::Span

For non-const `absl::Span` and conversion from `numpy` arrays, see
[non-const absl::Span](#non-const-abslspan) later.

When `absl::Span<const T>` (i.e. the `const` version) is considered, there is
full support to mapping into Python sequences.
Currently, this will always result in the list being copied, so you lose the
efficiency gains of spans in native C++, but you still get the API versatility.

The value type in the span can be any type that pybind knows about. However, it
must be immutable (ie, `absl::Span<const ValueType>`). Theoretically mutable
ValueTypes could be supported, but with some subtle limitations, and this is
not needed right now, so the implementation has been deferred.

The `convert` and `return_value_policy` parameters will apply to the *elements*.
The list containing those elements will aways be converted/copied.

### non-const absl::Span
Support for non-cost `absl::Span`, for numeric types only, is provided for
`numpy` arrays. Support is only for output function parameters and not for
returned value. The rationale behind this decision is that, if a `absl::Span`
were to be returned, the C++ object would have needed to outlive the mapped
Python object. Given the complexity of memory management across languages, we
did not add support of returned `absl::Span`.
That is the following is supported:

```
void Foo(absl::Span<double> some_span);
```
while the following is not (it will generate a compile error):
```
absl::Span<double> Bar();
```

Note: It is possible to use the non-const `absl::Span` bindings to wrap a
function with `absl::Span<const T>` argument if you are using `numpy` arrays
and you do not want a copy to be performed. This can be done by defining a
lambda function in the `pybind11` wrapper, as in the following example. See
b/155596364 for more details.

```
void MyConstSpanFunction(absl::Span<const double> a_span);
...

PYBIND11_MODULE(bindings, m) {
  m.def(
      "wrap_span",
      [](absl::Span<double> span) {
        MyConstSpanFunction(span);
      });
}
```


## absl::string_view

Supported exactly the same way pybind11 supports `std::string_view`.

## absl::optional

Supported exactly the same way pybind11 supports `std::optional`.

## absl::flat_hash_map

Supported exactly the same way pybind11 supports `std::map`.

## absl::flat_hash_set

Supported exactly the same way pybind11 supports `std::set`.

## absl::Status[Or]

To use the Status[Or] casters:

1. Include the header file `pybind11_abseil/status_casters.h`
   in the .cc file with your bindings.
1. Call `pybind11::google::ImportStatusModule();` in your `PYBIND11_MODULE`
   definition.

By default, an ok status will be converted into `None`, and a non-ok status will
raise a `status.StatusNotOk` exception. This has a `status` attribute which can
be used to access the status object and check the code/ message.

To get a `status.Status` object rather than having an exception thrown, pass
either the `Status` object or a function returning a `Status` to
`pybind11::google::DoNotThrowStatus` before casting or binding. This works with
references and pointers to `absl::Status` objects too.

See `status_utils.cc` in this directory for details about what methods are
available in wrapped `absl::Status` objects.

Example:

```cpp
#include "pybind11_abseil/status_casters.h"

absl::Status StatusReturningFunction() {
  return absl::Status(...);
}

pybind11::object StatusHandlingFunction() {
  return pybind11::cast(pybind11::google::DoNotThrowStatus(StatusReturningFunction()));
}

PYBIND11_MODULE(test_bindings, m) {
  pybind11::google::ImportStatusModule();

  m.def("return_status", &StatusReturningFunction,
        "Return None if StatusCode is OK, otherwise raise an error.");
  m.def("make_status", google::DoNotThrowStatus(&StatusReturningFunction),
        "Return a wrapped status object without raising an error.");
  m.def("status_handling_function", &StatusHandlingFunction,
        "Same effect as make_status, but cast is done internally.");
};
```

Python:

```python
from pybind11_abseil import status
import test_bindings

my_status = make_status()
if my_status.code():
  ...

try:
  return_status()
except status.StatusNotOk as e:
  print(e.status)
```

### absl::StatusOr

`absl::StatusOr` objects behave exactly like `absl::Status` objects, except:

- There is no support for passing StatusOr objects. You can only return them.
- Instead of returning None or a wrapped status with OK, this casts and
  returns the payload when there is no error.

As with `absl::Status`, the default behavior is to throw an error when casting
a non-ok status. You may pass a StatusOr object or StatusOr returning function
to `pybind11::google::DoNotThrowStatus` in exactly the same way as with
`absl::Status` to change this behavior.

`absl::StatusOr` objects must be returned by value (not reference or pointer).
Why? Because the implementation takes advantage of the fact that python is a
dynamically typed language to cast and return the payload *or* the
`absl::Status` object (or raise an exeception). Python has no concept of a
`absl::StatusOr` object, so it's also impossible to apply the
return_value_policy to a `absl::StatusOr`. Therefore returning a reference or
pointer to a `absl::StatusOr` is meaningless.

Pointers *can* be used as the payload type, and the return_value_policy will
be applied to the payload if the status is OK. However, references cannot be
used as the payload type, because that's a restriction on `absl::StatusOr` in
general, not pybind11 (see https://yaqs/5903163345338368).

This can handle any type of payload that pybind knows about. unique_ptrs
(ie, `absl::StatusOr<std::unique_ptr<...>>`) to wrapped classes or
structs (ie, any type which you created bindings for using
`pybind11::class_<...>`) can be used, but unique_ptrs to converted types (eg,
`int`, `string`, `absl::Time`, `absl::Duration`, etc) cannot be used.

### Aliasing parts of the status module

The need to import the `status` module can be eliminated by aliasing the parts
of the status module that are needed in your own module:

```cpp
PYBIND11_MODULE(test_bindings, m) {
  auto status_module = pybind11::google::ImportStatusModule();
  m.attr("StatusNotOk") = status_module.attr("StatusNotOk");

  ...
}
```

Python:

```python
import test_bindings

try:
  return_status()
except test_bindings.StatusNotOk as e:
  print(e.status)

```

### Importing the status module

The status module uses the same import mechansim as the proto module; see [its
documentation](../pybind11_protobuf/README.md#importing-the-proto-module)
for details. For now there is a `#ifdef` to allow `ImportStatusModule` to work
with python 2 rather than giving an error, but this will be removed eventually.

If modifying the following functions, make the same changes in the
corresponding proto functions:
- ImportStatusModule
- IsStatusModuleImported
- CheckStatusModuleImported

### Use Outside of Google3

The path used for the status module may be changed by altering the value of
`PYBIND11_ABSEIL_STATUS_MODULE_PATH` defined in `status_casters.h`. This uses
the same mechanism as the proto module, so see [its documentation]
(../pybind11_protobuf/README.md?cl=head#use-outside-of-google3)
for details.
